#### List of what the compiler can do:
-Integer declaration and affectation (even complexe one)
-IF/Else with nested if/else statements 
-global variable declaration 
-Function declaration
-Print (for now simple ids)
-Arithmetical operations
-Logical operations
-While statement 
-Constant declaration (once we've init can't change it anymore)
-Convert the ASM file with a register approach (including load and store)

### List of what I didn't manage to do
-Code an interpreter for the ASM register oriented 
-Function call (Set les bonnes addresse de retour et les bons appelle)

#### To test the compiler, just execute the bash script associated with the functionnality that you want to test 
(example : want to check if integer declaration and assignement if functionnal : ./intDecAndAssign)
