List of what the compiler can do:
-Integer declaration and affectation (even complexe one)
-IF/Else with nested if/else statements 
-global variable declaration 
-Function declaration
-Print (for now simple ids)
-Arithmetical operations
-Logical operations

@TODO 
-While statement 
-Constant declaration (once we've init can't change it anymore)
-Function call 
-Convert the ASM file with a register approach
-Code an interpreter for the ASM register oriented
